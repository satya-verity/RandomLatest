A(1) = 3.14
AST
<PROGRAM id="QuickBasicProgram" scope="MODULE" line="1">
    <ASSIGN line="4" type_id="double">
        <VARIABLE id="A" scope="PROCEDURE" type_id="double">
            <SUBSCRIPTS type_id="double">

3.7. ITypeSpec
This interface represents a type specification in the symbol table. It has the following read-only properties:

Form: This property is of TypeForm type. It represents the form of the type specification, such as scalar, enumeration, subrange, array, or record.

Identifier: This property is of ISymTabEntry type. It represents the symbol table entry for the identifier of the type specification.

BaseType: This property is of ITypeSpec type. It represents the base type of the type specification. For example, in the case of an array type, the base type would be the type of the elements in the array.

Properties: This property is of TypeSpecProperties type. It represents the properties of the type specification. The properties can vary depending on the form of the type specification.

3.8. TypeForm
This enumeration has definitions for meta types (type of types). 

SCALAR - Represents a scalar type, which holds a single value. Examples include integer, real, boolean, etc.
ENUMERATION - Represents an enumeration type, which is a user-defined type consisting of a set of named values.
SUBRANGE - Represents a subrange type, which is a range of values of an ordinal type. For example, 1â€¦10 is a subrange of the integer type.
ARRAY - Represents an array type, which is a collection of elements that are of the same type and are identified by index values.
RECORD - Represents a record type, which is a complex type that groups related fields of diverse types into a single type.
3.9. ISysTabEntry
The bridge interface to Symbol Table subsystem. Please see details in Symbol Table Design document.
